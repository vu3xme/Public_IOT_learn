# Enable Remote Access/ Authentication
# To enable remote access so that we can communicate with IoT devices, we need to edit/create a configuration file.
# We’ll add authentication with user and password.
# 1) Run the following command, but replace YOUR_USERNAME with the username you want to use:

sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/passwd YOUR_USERNAME
sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/passwd Your_password
# save username and password for future use
# This previous command creates a password file called passwd on the /etc/mosquitto directory. Now, we need to edit the mosquitto configuration file so that it only allows authentication with the username and password we’ve defined.
# 2) Run the following command to edit the configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
# Add the following line at the top of the file (make sure it is at the top of the file, otherwise it won’t work):
/*
per_listener_settings true
allow_anonymous false
listener 1883
password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd
*/

# final look of the file like below

/*
# Place your local configuration in /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/
#
# A full description of the configuration file is at
# /usr/share/doc/mosquitto/examples/mosquitto.conf.example
#below line add first line otherwise not work
/*
per_listener_settings true 
allow_anonymous false
listener 1883
password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd
pid_file /run/mosquitto/mosquitto.pid

persistence true
persistence_location /var/lib/mosquitto/

log_dest file /var/log/mosquitto/mosquitto.log

include_dir /etc/mosquitto/conf.d
#file here added line
allow_anonymous false
listener 1883
password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd

*/

# 6) Restart Mosquitto for the changes to take effect.
sudo systemctl restart mosquitto
 sudo systemctl status mosquitto
